This project was created using Jekyll and Tailwind CSS!
I had never used Jekyll before, but I wanted to give it a try. However, I couldn't let go of Tailwind CSS because it's so convenient to use!
While searching the internet for how to set up Jekyll with Tailwind CSS, I found this: https://mzrn.sh/2022/04/09/starting-a-blank-jekyll-site-with-tailwind-css-in-2022/.
It worked like a charm!
