This project is created with jekyll and tailwindcss!
I never used jekyll but i wanted to give it a try. But somehow i can't let go off tailwindcss, because its pretty convinient to use!
So i was searching the internet about how to setup jekyll with tailwindcss. And then i found this https://mzrn.sh/2022/04/09/starting-a-blank-jekyll-site-with-tailwind-css-in-2022/
Worked like a charm!
